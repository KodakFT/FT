A polished version for analyzing fourier transforms
I optimized Valerio Velardo's code from his webseries "Audio Signal Processing for Machine Learning" Episode 10
I have made this to allow anyone to use the code he created to perform fourier transform and inverse fourier transform and gain the 
in depth insights

Make sure to use pip in order to have these libraries
librosa
scipy 
matplotlib
numpy
and --upgrade librosa matplotlib

and not to mention python
